<td><strong>Opcode Instruction Description</strong> NP 0F C7 /6 VMPTRLD m64 Loads the current VMCS pointer from memory<em>.</em></td></tr></table>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marks the current-VMCS pointer valid and loads it with the physical address in the instruction operand. The instruction fails if its operand is not properly aligned, sets unsupported physical-address bits, or is equal to the VMXON pointer. In addition, the instruction fails if the 32 bits in memory referenced by the operand do not match the VMCS revision identifier supported by this processor.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The operand of this instruction is always 64 bits and is always in memory.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<pre>IF (register operand) or (not in VMX operation) or (CR0.PE = 0) or (RFLAGS.VM = 1) or (IA32_EFER.LMA = 1 and CS.L = 0)
    THEN #UD;
ELSIF in VMX non-root operation
    THEN VMexit;
ELSIF CPL &gt; 0
    THEN #GP(0);
    ELSE
        addr ← contents of 64-bit in-memory source operand;
        IF addr is not 4KB-aligned OR
        addr sets any bits beyond the physical-address width<sup>3</sup>
            THEN VMfail(VMPTRLD with invalid physical address);
        ELSIF addr = VMXON pointer
            THEN VMfail(VMPTRLD with VMXON pointer);
            ELSE
                rev ← 32 bits located at physical address addr;
                IF rev[30:0] ≠ VMCS revision identifier supported by processor OR
                rev[31] = 1 AND processor does not support 1-setting of “VMCS shadowing”
                    THEN VMfail(VMPTRLD with incorrect VMCS revision identifier);
                    ELSE
                        current-VMCS pointer ← addr;

<blockquote>
<p>2. Software should consult the VMX capability MSR VMX_BASIC to discover the VMCS revision identifier supported by this processor (see Appendix A, “VMX Capability Reporting Facility”).</p>
<p>3. If IA32_VMX_BASIC[48] is read as 1, VMfail occurs if addr sets any bits in the range 63:32; see Appendix A.1.</p></blockquote>
