<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the destination operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components saved correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.</p>
<p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>.</p>
<p>Section 13.7, “Operation of XSAVE,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVE instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>XSAVE saves state component <em>i </em>if and only if RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 1.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>XSAVE does not modify bytes 511:464 of the legacy region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.1, “Legacy Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li>
<li>XSAVE reads the XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE header (see Section 13.4.2, “XSAVE Header”) and writes a modified value back to memory as follows. If RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 1, XSAVE writes XSTATE_BV[<em>i</em>] with the value of XINUSE[<em>i</em>]. (XINUSE is a bitmap by which the processor tracks the status of various state components. See Section 13.6, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State.”) If RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 0, XSAVE writes XSTATE_BV[<em>i</em>] with the value that it read from memory (it does not modify the bit). XSAVE does not write to any part of the XSAVE header other than the XSTATE_BV field.</li>
<li>XSAVE always uses the standard format of the extended region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.3, “Extended Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. An exception is made for MXCSR and MXCSR_MASK, which belong to state component 1 — SSE. XSAVE saves these values to memory if either RFBM[1] or RFBM[2] is 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<pre>RFBM ← XCR0 AND EDX:EAX; /* bitwise logical AND */
OLD_BV ← XSTATE_BV field from XSAVE header;
IF RFBM[0] = 1
    THEN store x87 state into legacy region of XSAVE area;
FI;
IF RFBM[1] = 1
</pre>
<pre>    THEN store XMM registers into legacy region of XSAVE area; // this step does not save MXCSR or MXCSR_MASK
FI;
IF RFBM[1] = 1 OR RFBM[2] = 1
    THEN store MXCSR and MXCSR_MASK into legacy region of XSAVE area;
FI;
FOR i ← 2 TO 62
    IF RFBM[i] = 1
        THEN save XSAVE state component i at offset n from base of XSAVE area (n enumerated by CPUID(EAX=0DH,ECX=i):EBX);
    FI;
ENDFOR;
XSTATE_BV field in XSAVE header ← (OLD_BV AND NOT RFBM) OR (XINUSE AND RFBM);
