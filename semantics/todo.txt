// idiv/div hook implement (divide error)
add_single test you will a diff like
ymm1: Nan (our) 00000
after a movq 0 -> xmm1

we need a lemma which can extract(( 224'0, NaN) , 0, 128) and for this we have to enable lemmas
but checkout the maxmin failure which is overcome by comenting the lemmas out

testing (Instr level)
  Write a scriot which can generate individual command line by reading each test input from tc file.
//pcmpestri_xmm_m128_imm8
//pcmpestrm_xmm_m128_imm8
//pcmpestrm_xmm_xmm_imm8
//pcmpistri_xmm_m128_imm8

   It succeeds only speculatively, because the branch predictor has been primed to assume that the bounds check will succeed.
