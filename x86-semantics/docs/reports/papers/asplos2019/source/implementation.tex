\subsection{Porting Strata Formulas to K Rules}

Strata could ouput the internal AST, used to model a register state formula, in different
formats. SUpported backend are SmtLib and Prefix notation. We have added another backend 
to generate K rule.

\paragraph{Validate the Porting}
The K rules generated using the backend are matched against the ones we
obtained via symbolic execution on stratified instructions
This had two benefits:
 
 1. Gain confidence in porting.  
 2. In order to get the exact match we need to port all the verification lemma
 from K to strata code, which will later help in generating simplied K rules for
 non-stratified instructions.
